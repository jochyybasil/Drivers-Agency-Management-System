# Introduction

## Case Study: Hire Driver Company

**Hire Driver Co. Ltd** is a recruitment agency with the exclusive aim of providing a wide range of reliable and safe drivers to customers. It is a newly established company with an office in Accra, Ghana, and targets recruiting 300+ drivers and supplying to over 200 customers by the end of its second year of operation. The company primarily targets low-income and middle-income drivers while serving middle-income and upper-income individuals, families, businesses, organizations, and institutions seeking drivers for various needs, including temporary, part-time, full-time, and seasonal roles.

### Company Overview
Hire Driver Co. Ltd recruits and supplies legally licensed and insured drivers with features that suit customer preferences. A hire is made by pairing customers with their ideal candidates once it has been assured that the drivers can fulfill any role requirements specified by the customer. The company operates with five primary teams:
1. **Human Resources Team**
2. **Hire Control Team**
3. **Marketing Team**
4. **Finance Team**
5. **Training Team**

### Operations
Hire Driver Co. Ltd. serves two types of customers:
- **Individuals**
- **Groups** (such as families, schools, businesses, and institutions)

Groups that hire more than three drivers are offered special discounts. The recruitment process involves conducting background checks and assessing compliance with relevant regulations before drivers are signed up. Drivers may sign up with or without a vehicle, and customers can either provide their own vehicle or choose to use the driver's. Training is based on the highest type of driver's license the recruit holds.

After assessing customers’ preferences and matching them with appropriate drivers, a hire contract is signed between the driver, the agency, and the customer. Customers pay the company directly, and drivers are compensated according to the terms of their contracts.

The **Marketing Team** is responsible for promoting the company and developing strategic services. The **Finance Team** manages accounting, financial planning, and budgeting. The **Training Team** ensures that drivers receive the necessary training for their roles, while the **Hire Control Team** manages and oversees hires to ensure compliance.

### Reason for this Project
Hire Driver Co. Ltd. recruits a diverse range of drivers and serves multiple customers with varying requirements. Due to the variability in customer demands and driver characteristics, there have been inefficiencies in pairing customers with suitable drivers. Additionally, because data about drivers and client preferences are not centralized, it is difficult for the Human Resources team to keep up-to-date records on the types of drivers that are in high demand. This has led to the recruitment of drivers who are less sought after.

Management has expressed the need for a centralized database system that will allow the company to track and manage records of drivers, clients, training sessions, and hires. This will enable the company to better match customers with drivers based on specific requirements and qualifications. Furthermore, management aims to ensure that drivers receive the necessary training before they are assigned roles, while also ensuring compliance with hire contracts.

### Functionalities
The database system design should enable the following key functionalities:
- **Human Resources** to identify trends in client preferences for drivers.
- **Management** to ensure that customer preferences align with driver characteristics.
- **Finance and Marketing Teams** to track high-profit customers and the types of customers who make hires.
- **Training Team** to assign the appropriate training sessions to drivers.
- **Management** to monitor the hiring status of drivers since they joined.
- **Hire Control Team** to monitor hires’ compliance with contract terms and conditions.

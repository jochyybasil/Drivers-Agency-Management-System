## Assumptions

I have assumed that:
- A driver becomes one only after going through the screening process because the needs to give safety and reliability to its clients hence there is no recruitment process on the er diagram.
- No team can have less than one staff member because at all times there should be at least one staff on a team hence the participation between team and staff is mandatory.
- A training session should have at least 3 drivers because training sessions run only after drivers have completed their recruitment process hence the participation between training session and driver is 3.
- A driver can be hired by different clients so far as the current contract has ended because each contract has a duration and might not be renewed hence the cardinality between driver and hire contract is many.
- A driver has one license category because drivers are recorded and trained based on the highest category they have hence the cardinality for driver and license category is one.
- A driver may not have any insurance or may have more than one because not every driver possesses a vehicle and drivers can have other forms of insurance hence the participation between driver and insurance type is optional.
- A driver has one working availability because … hence the cardinality between driver and working availability is 1.

# System Requirements

## 1. **Functional Requirements**

The database system is designed to manage key components of a transportation and client hire service. The system will handle:

1. **Client Management**:
   - Create, update, and delete client records.
   - Track client details including contact information and type (individual or group).
   - Assign and manage client contracts.

2. **Driver Management**:
   - Track driver details including personal information, license categories, and vehicle data.
   - Manage driver training sessions and ensure drivers' participation in necessary training.
   - Record insurance types for drivers.

3. **Staff Management**:
   - Manage staff records, including roles (team lead, manager) and personal information.
   - Track staff assignments to teams and monitor training and contract management tasks.
   
4. **Team Management**:
   - Create, manage, and update team details.
   - Assign staff members to teams and track the team composition.
   - Monitor team lead assignments and staff distribution within teams.

5. **Training Session Management**:
   - Create and manage training sessions for drivers.
   - Track training session details such as description, capacity, and number of attendees.

6. **Hire Contract Management**:
   - Track client hire contracts, including start/end dates, contract terms, and payment information.
   - Record and calculate hire payments, including the application of discount packages and payment methods.
   
7. **Insurance Management**:
   - Assign insurance types to drivers.
   - Track insurance details and expiration dates for drivers.
   
8. **Discount Package Management**:
   - Create and apply discount packages to hire payments.
   - Track which clients are entitled to discount packages.

9. **Payment Management**:
   - Track hire payments including amount paid, payment method, and payment status.
   - Manage and calculate any applicable discounts for hire payments.
   
10. **Reporting and Data Retrieval**:
    - Generate reports on client, driver, staff, hire contracts, and payments.
    - Perform complex queries to track hire contracts, payments, and client status.

## 2. **Non-Functional Requirements**

These requirements define the system's overall quality and operational characteristics.

1. **Performance**:
   - The system should be able to handle a minimum of **50 concurrent users** with fast response times (less than 5 seconds for data retrieval operations).
   - Queries, especially complex ones, should return results within 10 seconds.

2. **Security**:
   - The system should implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel can perform sensitive tasks (e.g., viewing/editing payments, driver details).
   - Data should be encrypted during storage and transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS for web access).
   - Backup and restore processes should be in place for data security.

3. **Scalability**:
   - The system should support the future growth of the organization, accommodating increasing numbers of clients, drivers, staff, and hire contracts.
   - The system architecture should support easy scaling in terms of database performance, adding new staff roles, teams, or other system modules.

4. **Usability**:
   - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, especially for administrative users.
   - System documentation should be comprehensive and clear to ensure easy training for new users.

5. **Availability**:
   - The system should be **99.9% available** during business hours (8 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday).
   - Scheduled downtime for maintenance should be communicated in advance and kept minimal.

6. **Data Integrity**:
   - The system must maintain data accuracy, with checks for redundancy and consistency (e.g., ensuring no duplicate client records).
   - Data should be validated both at the user interface level and the database level to prevent incorrect or incomplete data entry.

7. **Compliance**:
   - The system should comply with relevant legal and regulatory standards, particularly in handling sensitive information like client details and driver data.
   - Ensure privacy policies are adhered to, especially with respect to personal data.

### 3. **System Constraints**

1. **Database Size**:
   - The database is expected to grow to **50GB** in the first 2 years, requiring efficient indexing and optimization strategies.

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - The system should be built using relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as **PostgreSQL** for data storage and management.
   - Web-based interface using **HTML & CSS** for frontend, connected to a backend developed in **Python**.

4. **User Base**:
   - The system will primarily be used by administrative staff, managers, team leads, and HR personnel for managing client hires, training, and driver-related data.

5. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - The system should include **daily backups** of all key data, with weekly full backups and logs stored for **30 days**.

## 4. **Hardware Requirements**
  
- **Client**:
  - Any modern computer or mobile device with internet access for users (web-based system).
  - **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS for server-side operations.
  - **Browser**: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for the client interface.
